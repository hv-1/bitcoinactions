Summary

TX Highway aims to showcase in a fun, clear and dynamic way the key benefits of Bitcoin BSV (BCH before) over BTC  by
 creating an interactive blockchain visualizer that monitors actions on BSV and BTC. Building off
  the success of the before launched legacy txhighway (see parent here on Github), Cash Drop app (https://porlybe.github.io/cashdrop/), developed by Porlybe 
  and inspired by the popular Bit Bonkers (bitbonkers.com).

We're currently looking at our options for hosting. 
We believe a hosted Github page will likely work with a custom domain. 
Although we may require some hosting to properly pull data from planaria, whatsonchain.com, etc.
 We have reached out to a member of the Bitcoin Metanet.ICU slack with more experience in hosting 
 secure sites to see if they'd be interested in teaming up. 
 Judging by our demo's we're fairly sure free Github Pages will suffice.
